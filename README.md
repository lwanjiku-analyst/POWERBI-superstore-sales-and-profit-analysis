##  Key Visuals & Findings  

### 1. Sales & Profit by Year  
**Visualization Used:** Line Chart  

**How have overall sales and profit trends evolved year-over-year, and what does this indicate about business growth between 2021 and 2024?**

![Sales & Profit by Year](sales_profit_year.png)

**What it shows (2021 â†’ 2024):**
- **2021:** Sales **$225,942** | Profit **$19,987**
- **2022:** Sales **$234,566** | Profit **$16,035**  *(profit dip)*
- **2023:** Sales **$302,278** | Profit **$33,690**
- **2024:** Sales **$357,821** | Profit **$37,225**  *(peak)*

**Interpretation:**  
Sales grew steadily from **$226K â†’ $358K** over four years. Profit **fell in 2022** (likely higher costs/discounts) but **rebounded strongly** in 2023 and reached a **new high in 2024**. This pattern suggests margin pressure in 2022 followed by improved pricing/cost control in later years.
 

## 2) % of Sales by Category (Yearly)

**Visualization Used:** Stacked Bar Chart 

**How did the sales contribution of each category (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology) change between 2021 and 2024?**

![% of sales by Category](sales_by_category.png)

- **Furniture:** Increased its sales share from **11.9% in 2021** to **16.3% in 2024**, showing stronger positioning in the market.  
- **Office Supplies:** Declined slightly from **10% in 2021** to **7% in 2024**, indicating reduced contribution to overall sales.  
- **Technology:** Dropped from **5% in 2021** to **4% in 2024**, suggesting stagnation compared to Furnitureâ€™s upward trend.  

**Insight:** Over the four years, **Furniture emerged as the key growth driver in sales share**, while **Office Supplies and Technology lost ground**, signaling potential need for strategy adjustments in those categories.
